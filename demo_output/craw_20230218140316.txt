credential
stuffing
using
a
burp
intruder
pitchfork
attack
last
february
read
minutes
burp
intruder
provides
a
number
of
different
attack
which
determine
the
way
in
which
payloads
are
injected
into
the
defined
payload
the
pitchfork
attack
type
is
useful
in
cases
where
an
attack
requires
you
to
send
specific
combinations
of
payloads
from
different
lists
in
the
same
in
this
how
a
pitchfork
attack
works
how
to
configure
a
basic
pitchfork
attack
with
two
sets
of
payloads
how
to
perform
a
credential
stuffing
attack
what
is
credential
credential
stuffing
is
a
form
of
attack
in
which
an
attacker
attempts
to
log
in
to
a
site
using
a
dictionary
of
known
pairs
from
one
or
more
other
these
sets
of
credentials
are
typically
obtained
via
earlier
data
pitchfork
attacks
are
ideal
for
this
purpose
because
you
can
ensure
that
each
username
is
sent
with
its
matching
as
you
can
see
from
the
example
the
first
item
from
each
payload
list
is
sent
then
the
second
item
from
each
and
so
perform
an
attack
just
like
this
in
the
following
note
browser
is
an
easy
way
to
proxy
http
traffic
even
over
the
encrypted
https
there
is
no
setup
required
simply
go
to
the
proxy
click
open
browser
and
ensure
intercept
is
off
step
open
the
lab
using
access
the
following
note
while
this
lab
is
not
intended
to
demonstrate
this
it
does
feature
a
simple
login
form
that
we
can
use
as
an
step
send
a
login
request
to
burp
intruder
in
the
click
the
my
account
link
to
open
the
login
submit
the
login
form
using
any
arbitrary
in
burp
go
to
the
proxy
http
history
find
the
post
the
request
and
select
send
to
intruder
step
select
the
attack
type
at
the
top
of
the
positions
use
the
attack
type
menu
to
select
pitchfork
step
configure
the
payload
positions
click
on
the
intruder
tab
and
go
to
the
with
your
request
on
the
intruder
positions
this
shows
the
with
markers
automatically
inserted
around
everything
burp
has
identified
as
a
potential
insertion
this
may
include
things
like
cookies
that
you
do
not
want
to
replace
with
a
use
the
clear
button
to
clear
all
of
in
our
we
are
only
replacing
the
username
and
highlight
the
value
of
the
username
parameter
and
click
add
do
the
same
for
the
password
step
add
the
username
payloads
go
to
the
payloads
at
the
top
of
the
tab
is
the
payload
sets
this
lets
you
alternate
between
different
sets
of
payloads
and
configure
for
a
pitchfork
you
need
to
configure
the
same
number
payload
sets
as
select
payload
set
then
paste
the

you
can

analyze
the

you
can
sort
the
results
of
the

by
any
and
apply

by
clicking
the

this
can
help
you
to
spot
differences
between
responses
and
patterns
of
in
our
you
can
see
that
the
combination
of
wiener
and
peter
is
the
only
one
to
return
a
status
if
you
examine
the
response
to
this
you
can
see
that
the
server
sent
a
new
session
this
could
indicate
that
the
login
was
note
subsequent
login
attempts
receive
a
error
response
because
the
original
csrf
token
included
in
each
request
correspond
to
the
new
session
in
addition
to
sorting
the
you
can
also
configure
grep
settings
on
the
settings
tab
to
flag
results
that
match
a
pattern
of

or
extract

your
results
in
the
go
back

to
confirm
that
you
have
successfully
identified
a

summary
you
have
learned
to
configure
