last
february
read
minutes
burp
proxy
allows
you
to
configure
match
and
replace
rules
that
automatically
modify
your
requests
and
responses
while
you
explore
the
target
application
as
normal
using
this
enables
you
to
or
modify
headers
in
requests
or
for
there
are
a
number
of
uses
for
including
potentially
spoofing
your
ip
in
some
this
may
allow
you
to
trick
a
server
into
believing
that
you
belong
to
its
local
which
could
enable
you
to
communicate
with
internal
infrastructure
that
is
otherwise
in
this
tutorial
learn
how
set
match
and
replace
rules
in
burp
use
match
and
replace
rules
to
add
a
header
to
your
spoof
your
ip
address
to
compromise
a
vulnerable
server
that
uses
a
form
of
note
browser
is
an
easy
way
to
proxy
http
traffic
even
over
the
encrypted
https
there
is
no
setup
required
simply
go
to
the
proxy
click
open
browser
and
ensure
intercept
is
off
step
open
the
lab
open
browser
and
access
the
following
step
attempt
to
access
the
admin
panel
try
to
access
the
admin
panel
at
note
that
you
are
prevented
from
doing
so
as
this
is
only
accessible
to
local
for
assume
that
subsequently
identified
that
the
server
is
using
a
custom
http
to
determine
your
ip
note
in
the
the
standard
header
is
often
used
for
this
but
you
may
encounter
websites
that
use
different
custom
these
are
normally
applied
to
your
requests
by
an
intermediary
such
as
a
load
balancer
or
other
reverse
proxy
belonging
to
a
for
step
add
a
custom
match
and
replace
rule
in
burp
click
on
settings
to
open
the
settings
go
to
tools
proxy
under
match
and
replace
click
add
leave
the
match
field
this
ensures
that
burp
will
append
a
new
header
to
requests
rather
than
replacing
an
existing
in
the
replace
enter
the
click
ok
burp
proxy
will
now
add
this
header
to
every
request
you
make
in
step
try
to
access
the
admin
panel
again
in
try
browsing
to
observe
that
you
can
now
access
the
admin
page
and
delete
carlos
to
solve
the
in
you
can
confirm
that
the
header
was
added
to
your
requests
by
checking
them
in
the
logger
on
the
proxy
http
history
you
can
use
the
menu
to
toggle
between
the
original
request
that
was
sent
by
the
and
the
modified
one
that
burp
proxy
forwarded
to
the
note
although
manually
added
a
custom
header
in
this
burp
suite
provides
a
number
of
match
and
replace
rules
to
cover
some
of
the
most
common
use
you
just
need
to
enable
them
in
the
settings
under
proxy
tools
match
and
replace
rules
summary
and
next
steps
congratulations
now
you
know
how
to
use
burp
match
and
replace
and
have
used
them
to
spoof
your
ip
to
learn
how
you
could
have
discovered
the
custom
header
