last

a
resource
pool
is
a
group
of
tasks
that
share
a
quota
of
resource
pools
make
it
easier
for
you
manage
and
prioritize
the
usage
of
system
particularly
across
multiple
test
applications
that
tolerate
automated
requests
at
different
creating
resource
pools
new
tasks
are
assigned
to
a
default
resource
you
can
create
a
custom
pool
at
any
point
before
you
start
the
to
create
a
resource
go
to
intruder
resource
pool
select
create
new
resource
pool
enter
a
name
for
the
pool
and
configure
the
pool
the
pool
is
created
when
you
start
the
if
you
want
to
create
a
new
pool
after
the
attack
has
you
need
to
do
so
in
a
different
task
or
in

settings
dialog
under

tasks
resource
pool
settings
each
resource
pool
can
be
configured
with
its
own
throttling
maximum
concurrent
requests
limit
the
number
of
requests
that
the
attack
sends
this
is
useful
so
you
overload
the
target
server
or
exceed
the
configured
rate
delay
between
requests
this
is
in
you
can
choose
from
three
delay
fixed
with
random
variations
increase
delay
in
increments
this
enables
you
to
determine
the
time
taken
for
a
session
to
expire
if
no
requests
are
automatic
backoff
automatically
add
a
short
delay
between
requests
that
incrementally
increases
until
the
attack
complies
with
the
rate
this
is
enabled
in
the
default
resource
moving
tasks
between
resource
pools
to
move
a

before
you

and

move
a
task
during
an
