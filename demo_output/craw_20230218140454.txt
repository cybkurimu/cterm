burp
intruder
is
a
powerful
tool
for
performing
highly
automated
attacks
against
it
enables
you
to
configure
attacks
that
send
the
same
request
over
and
over
inserting
different
payloads
into
predefined
positions
each
among
other
you
can
use
intruder
fuzz
for
perform
enumerate
valid
identifiers
and
other
harvest
useful
the
best
way
to
understand
how
burp
intruder
works
is
to
see
it
in
you
can
follow
the
tutorial
below
to
launch
your
first
intruder
for
more
detailed
information
about
the
features
and
attack
types
of
burp
please
see
typical
uses
for
burp
intruder
tutorial
in
this
learn
the
basics
of
configuring
a
simple
intruder
attack
using
one
of
the
deliberately
vulnerable
labs
on
the
web
security
step
access
the
lab
open
and
use
it
to
access
the
following
click
access
the
lab
and
log
in
to
your
portswigger
account
if
this
opens
your
own
instance
of
a
deliberately
vulnerable
blog
step
try
to
log
in
click
my
account
then
try
to
log
in
using
an
invalid
username
and
in
burp
go
to
the
proxy
http
history
this
shows
all
of
the
requests
you
have
made
in
browser
since
opening
find
the
post
the
request
and
select
send
to
intruder
step
set
the
payload
positions
go
to
the
intruder
observe
that
there
is
now
a
tab
displaying
the
post
use
this
as
the
base
request
for
our
notice
that
burp
intruder
has
automatically
inserted
characters
in
various
positions
throughout
the
these
mark
the
beginning
and
end
of
a
payload
where
burp
intruder
will
attempt
to
insert
payloads
during
the
for
this
we
only
need
a
single
payload
position
in
the
username
click
clear
to
clear
the
default
positions
highlight
the
value
of
the
username
then
click
add
step
select
an
attack
type
at
the
top
of
the
you
can
select
different
attack
for
just
make
sure
this
is
set
to
sniper
a
sniper
attack
inserts
a
single
set
of
one
by
into
one
or
more
positions
within
the
step
add
the
payloads
you
now
just
need
to
configure
the
list
of
payloads
that
you
want
to
for
this
try
sending
the
request
with
different
usernames
to
test
how
the
login
mechanism
copy
the
following
list
of
candidate
candidate
usernames
go
to
the
payloads
leave
the
payload
type
set
to
simple
list
in
the
payload
settings
click
paste
to
add
the
copied
usernames
to
the
in
the
payload
sets
you
can
see
how
many
payloads
you
have
and
how
many
requests
this
attack
will
for
this
you
should
payload
request
step
start
the
attack
in
the
click
start
attack
this
opens
a
new
attack
window
in
which
you
can
see
each
of
the
requests
that
burp
intruder
is
if
you
select
one
of
the
entries
in
the
you
can
view
the
request
and
response
in
the
message
notice
that
the
username
parameter
contains
a
different
value
from
our
payload
list
in
each
step
look
for
any
irregular
responses
the
attack
window
contains
several
columns
displaying
key
information
about
each
wait
for
the
attack
to
then
click
the
heading
of
the
length
column
to
sort
the
as
you
can
one
of
the
responses
is
a
different
this
difference
in
response
from
the
server
is
worth
further
step
study
the
response
select
any
request
from
the
list
to
display
it
in
the
message
studying
the
notice
that
most
contain
an
invalid
username
error
but
the
one
with
the
different
length
response
has
an
incorrect
password
error
this
different
response
strongly
suggests
that
this
username
might
be
valid
in
this
what
now
that
you
have
a
potentially
correct
the
next
logical
step
is
to
try
to
the
try
repeating
this
using
the
username
you
have
identified
and
this
list
of
candidate
passwords
