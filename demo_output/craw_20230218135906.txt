creating
burp
extensions
last
february
read
minutes
if
proficient
in
you
can
create
your
own
extensions
for
burp
suite
using
our
montoya
note
that
burp
suite
only
supports
extensions
written
in
java
or
to
get
create
a
new
maven
or
gradle
project
and
add
a
dependency
for
the
montoya
api
as
maven
gradle
implementation
create
a
class
that
implements
the
burpextension
the
method
gives
you
an
implementation
of
the
montoyaapi
which
you
can
use
to
modify
and
interact
with
burp
when
your
extension
is
you
can
submit
it
to
the
bapp
store
to
share
it
with
other
burp
please
refer
to
submitting
extensions
to
the
bapp
store
and
bapp
store
acceptance
criteria
note
many
of
the
extensions
on
the
bapp
store
were
written
using
our
legacy
extender
api
burp
suite
will
continue
to
support
the
extender
api
for
the
time
but
we
strongly
recommend
writing
any
new
extensions
using
the
montoya
api
useful
resources
for
extension
developers
although
we
provide
detailed
instructions
on
how
to
write
your
own
you
can
refer
to
the
following
useful
the
montoya
api
github
repository
which
contains
some
example
implementations
of
common
such
as
registering
an
http
handler
or
proxy
the
montoya
api
javadoc
a
test
extension
that
uses
the
montoya
api
to
implement
most
of
the
functions
from
the
legacy
extender
api
this
provides
a
useful
especially
if
attempting
to
port
an
old
given
each
method
the
same
name
as
its
equivalent
in
the
extender
so
you
can
easily
find
what
looking
the
main
portswigger
github
repository
contains
a
forked
version
of
each
extension
that
is
available
on
the
bapp
as
well
as
some
simple
example
note
that
most
of
these
were
written
using
the
legacy
extender
api
note
when
you
write
make
sure
that
any
extensionhttprequesteditor
returned
does
not
use
an
httprequesteditor
as
the
ui
component
when
it
registers
an
httprequesteditorprovider
this
avoids
a
scenario
where
the
httprequesteditor
is
created
within
another
httprequesteditor
potentially
creating
an
infinite
loop
of
httprequesteditor
components
and
causing
burp
to
for
the
same
avoid
returning
an
httpresponseeditor
when
registering
an
httpresponseeditorprovider
handling
kettled
requests
in
extensions
when
issuing
new
requests
from
your
free
to
send
kettled
requests
using
this
enables
you
to
develop
extensions
to
test
for
vulnerabilities
it
is
not
currently
possible
for
extensions
to
modify
kettled
requests
that
were
issued
by
this
is
because
they
can
only
access
the
representation
of
them
