you
can
share
your
extensions
with
the
community
by
submitting
them
to
the
bapp
we
review
all
submitted
bapps
for
security
and
before
we
make
a
decision
on
whether
to
include
them
in
the
bapp
before
you
submit
your
make
sure
that
it
meets
the
following
acceptance
it
performs
a
unique
make
sure
that
your
extension
duplicate
the
function
of
an
existing
extension
in
the
bapp
if
your
idea
entirely
you
might
be
better
off
tailoring
an
existing
bapp
to
suit
your
you
can
find
the
source
code
for
every
extension
in
the
bapp
store
on
our
github
repository
it
has
a
descriptive
make
sure
that
the
name
clearly
describes
what
the
extension
you
can
also
provide
a
summary
that
appears
in
the
list
as
well
as
a
more
detailed
it
operates
users
may
be
testing
sites
that
they
so
important
that
extensions
expose
users
to
treat
the
content
of
http
messages
as
extensions
should
operate
securely
in
expected
data
entered
by
a
user
into
the
gui
can
generally
be
but
if
there
is
from
untrusted
assume
the
user
will
check
the
it
includes
all
a
major
benefit
of
the
bapp
store
is
if
your
extension
includes
all
it
is
much
easier
for
users
to
get
this
also
avoids
version
where
an
underlying
tool
is
updated
but
the
bapp
is

perform
slow
operations
such
as
http
requests
in
the
swing
event
dispatch
this
causes
burp
to
appear
as
the
whole
gui
must
wait
until
the
slow

avoid
slow
operations
when
using
proxyhttprequesthandler
proxyhttpresponsehandler
and
httphandler
to
avoid
concurrency
protect
shared
data
structures
with

take
care
to
avoid
note
burp
does
not
catch
and
report
exceptions
in

surround
the
full
thread
operation
with
a
block
and
write
any
stack
traces
to
the

error
it
unloads
when
an
extension
make
sure
that
it
releases
all
the
extension
needs
to
register
an
unload
via
the
most
common
example
of
resources
to
be
unloaded
is
background
important
that
background
threads
are
terminated
in
it
uses
burp
when
making
an
http
request
to
the
or
otherwise
preferable
to
use
instead
of
libraries
like
this
sends
the
request
through
the
burp
so
settings
like
upstream
proxies
and
session

be

avoid
performing
any
communication
to
the
target
from
within
it
supports
offline
some
burp
users
need
to
operate
from
networks
without
internet
to
support
these
extensions
that
contact
an
online
service
to
receive
vulnerability

or
other

users

avoid
keeping
references

passed
to

if
you

as
these

make

that
any

important
when

that
