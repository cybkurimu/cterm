augmenting

last
february
read
minutes
if
not
regularly
using
burp
scanner
as
part
of
your
manual
testing
wasting
far
more
time
and
effort
than
you
by
taking
advantage
of
a
couple
of
you
can
supplement
your
own
expert
knowledge
and
intuition
with
burp
methodical
approach
to
not
only
will
this
help
you
cover
more
be
able
to
spend
your
time
where
it
matters
rather
than
on
tedious
preliminary
scanning
specific
requests
when
you
come
across
an
interesting
function
or
your
first
instinct
may
be
to
send
the
relevant
requests
to
repeater
or
intruder
and
investigate
often
beneficial
to
send
the
request
to
burp
scanner
it
can
get
to
work
on
the
more
repetitive
aspects
of
testing
while
you
put
your
skills
to
better
use
step
open
the
lab
go
to
proxy
intercept
and
launch
use
it
to
access
the
following
this
should
open
a
deliberately
vulnerable
online
step
find
an
interesting
request
visit
one
of
the
product
in
go
to
the
proxy
http
history
observe
that
the
resulting
get
request
contains
a
query
parameter
and
a
couple
of
all
of
which
are
user
this
makes
it
a
good
place
to
start
looking
for
step
launch
a
quick
scan
on
this
either
in
the
message
editor
panel
or
from
the
list
of
and
select
do
active
scan
burp
scanner
immediately
begins
running
an
scan
using
its
default
if
you
want
more
control
over
how
the
request
is
and
select
scan
this
the
scan
launcher
allowing
you
to
adjust
the
configuration
before
the
scan
scanning
insertion
points
already
learned
how
to
scan
specific
but
you
can
optimize
this
even
further
by
only
scanning
with
specific
insertion
points
that
you
think
might
be
of
step
send
the
request
to
intruder
send
the
same
get
request
we
used
in
the
previous
tutorial
to
burp
intruder
and
go
to
the
intruder
step
set
the
payload
insertion
points
as
you
can
burp
intruder
has
identified
three
potential
insertion
points
and
burp
scanner
uses
even
more
than
this
by
clear
the
default
payload
positions
and
set
new
ones
for
the
productid
and
trackingid
step
launch
the
scan
on
the
request
and
select
scan
defined
insertion
points
from
you
can
launch
a
scan
that
will
only
place
payloads
in
the
two
positions
explicitly
this
can
massively
reduce
the
number
of
requests
made
by
burp
step
view
the
results
this
approach
can
yield
results
incredibly
giving
you
something
to
work
with
in
just
a
couple
of
from
the
dashboard
notice
that
the
scan
is
already
finished
and
has
found
a
sql
injection
summary
now
learned
how
to
use
burp
scanner
during
manual
in
addition
to
what
learned
so
here
are
a
few
extra
often
want
to
scan
using
just
a
single
you
can
do
this
even
quicker
by
installing
the
scan
manual
insertion
point
extension
from
the
bapp
manually
defining
insertion
points
also
lets
you
scan
using
inputs
that
burp
scanner
would
normally
such
as
custom
header
you
can
also
use
this
technique
to
scan
data
which
burp
scanner
may
not
be
able
to
parse
