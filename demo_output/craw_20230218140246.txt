reducing
noise
during
manual
testing
last
february
read
minutes
when
proxying
traffic
through
burp
for
the
first
you
may
be
surprised
by
the
sheer
number
of
requests
that
take
place
as
you
burp
provides
a
variety
of
features
to
help
you
reduce
as
much
noise
as
this
allows
you
to
focus
your
time
and
effort
where
it
matters
and
makes
it
much
easier
to
analyze
the
target
in
this
learn
how
configure
a
basic
target
prevent
traffic
from
being
logged
across
apply
filters
so
that
you
can
focus
on
specific
items
interested
setting
a
basic
target
scope
setting
the
target
scope
should
be
one
of
the
first
things
you
do
no
matter
what
not
only
does
this
help
you
get
the
most
out
of
it
may
prevent
you
from
sending
potentially
harmful
requests
to
hosts
that
you
have
permission
to
step
use
browser
go
to
the
proxy
intercept
tab
and
launch
the
use
it
to
open
the
following
step
create
a
target
scope
from
the
site
map
after
the
lab
go
to
the
proxy
http
history
in
addition
to
the
requests
to
the
deliberately
vulnerable
shopping
see
requests
to
and
a
variety
of
other
hosts
related
to
services
and
browser
go
to
the
target
site
map
tab
and
notice
that
there
are
also
entries
for
each
of
these
hosts
in
your
site
on
the
entry
for
and
select
add
to
scope
step
disable
logging
of
traffic
burp
now
recognizes
that
you
have
defined
a
scope
for
the
project
and
asks
whether
you
want
to
stop
logging
data
for
click
yes
any
new
requests
that
the
browser
makes
will
now
only
appear
in
burp
if
they
are
sent
to
note
you
can
logging
of
traffic
at
any
time
by
clicking
the
button
at
the
top
of
the
proxy
step
refine
the
scope
go
to
the
target
scope
tab
and
observe
that
the
lab
url
has
been
added
to
the
list
of
included
by
all
paths
or
endpoints
of
this
host
are
considered
to
exclude
specific
you
can
add
a
url
to
the
exclude
from
scope
list
using
the
provided
on
the
relevant
node
in
the
site
map
and
select
remove
from
scope
note
that
you
can
also
do
this
by
on
individual
requests
in
the
proxy
for
there
are
some
more
advanced
options
for
configuring
a
scope
using
regular
but
cover
these
in
a
separate
using
filters
throughout
there
are
a
variety
of
filter
settings
that
allow
you
to
temporarily
hide
data
that
relevant
to
your
current
step
view
the
proxy
history
go
to
the
proxy
http
history
although
burp
logging
any
more
the
history
still
shows
a
number
of
requests
that
were
logged
before
we
set
a
step
open
the
filter
settings
just
above
the
list
of
notice
the
filter
this
displays
a
summary
of
which
filters
are
currently
note
that
some
filters
are
enabled
by
so
this
may
already
contain
a
few
click
this
bar
to
open
the
filter
step
apply
a
filter
to
hide
items
notice
that
you
have
a
range
of
options
for
filtering
based
on
mime
response
status
specific
search
and
so
find
similar
filter
bars
with
different
options
in
some
of
other
in
the
corner
of
the
filter
settings
select
the
show
only
items
option
and
click
apply
observe
that
all
of
the
requests
to
other
hosts
have
now
disappeared
from
the
proxy
allowing
you
to
focus
on
requests
that
are
related
to
the
now
you
know
how
to
configure
a
basic
target
scope
and
apply
filters
in
these
simple
skills
are
essential
for
testing
live
sites
