enumerating

using
burp

last

minutes
burp
intruder
makes
it
possible
to
automate
attacks
against
more
than
one
target
in
this
we
show
how
you
can
use
this
feature
to
discover
additional
attack
surface
by
enumerating
valid
subdomains
of
a
given
this
technique
is
particularly
useful
when
performing
it
can
be
repurposed
in
many
for
example
to
automate
a
single
attack
against
multiple
note
intruder
attacks
were
introduced
into
burp
suite
in
version
you
may
need
to
update
burp
suite
to
the
latest
version
to
access
these
in
this
learn
how
configure
a
basic
sniper
use
burp
intruder
to
enumerate
subdomains
for
a
target
spot
potentially
interesting
items
in
burp
intruder
attack
for
the
purpose
of
this
pretend
that
we
have
been
given
a
web
application
to
perform
security
testing
any
content
we
discover
within
this
application
is
considered
valid
for
as
part
of
our
reconnaissance
we
therefore
search
for
subdomains
to
perform
testing
using
burp
note
browser
is
an
easy
way
to
proxy
http
traffic
even
over
the
encrypted
https
there
is
no
setup
required
simply
go
to
the
proxy
click
open
browser
and
ensure
intercept
is
off
step
intercept
a
request
open
browser
and
access
the
following
in
burp
go
to
the
proxy
and
click
the
http
history
sub
here
you
can
see
a
list
of
the
http
requests
made
by
browser
since
you
opened
burp
right
click
the
request
you
just
made
to
and
click
send
to
intruder
step
configure
intruder
insertion
points
open
the
intruder
where
your
request
is
now
in
the
target
add
a
placeholder
select
the
placeholder
subdomain
and
click
the
add
button
to
mark
it
as
a
payload
step
select
the
intruder
attack
type
in
this
we
are
using
a
single
insertion
point
with
a
sniper
attack
type
to
cause
intruder
to
cycle
through
a
list
of
potential
subdomain
note
that
is
selected
under
choose
an
attack
type
note
also
that
some
other
intruder
attack
types
can
use
two
or
more
insertion
step
add
potential
subdomains
as
intruder
payloads
for
the
purpose
of
this
we
are
using
a
list
of
payloads
that
comes
with
burp
suite
bear
in
mind
that
experienced
testers
often
curate
their
own
lists
for
use
in
such
note
the
add
from
list
feature
is
exclusive
to
burp
suite
professional
if
you
wish
to
follow
this
tutorial
using
burp

read
step
to
find
an
interesting
directory
name
then
add
this
name
to
the
payload
settings
field
as
shown
in
step
in
the
intruder
click
the
payloads
under
payload
settings
click
the
add
from
list
drop
select
this
populates
the
payload
settings
field
with
a
list
of
potential
directory
step
analyze
attack
results
click
the
start
attack
button
and
wait
for
your
attack
to
finish
running
this
may
take
a
click
the
header
of
the
length
column
to
sort
the
list
of
responses
by
observe
that
where
most
requests
have
a
length
of
the
request
where
the
subdomain
staff
has
been
used
has
a
length
of
this
indicates
that
the
response
to
this
request
contains
different
content
than
the
others
in
the
select
the
interesting
click
response
to
view
the
response
associated
with
the
this
shows
you
that
the
url
points
to
a
login
form
of
some
open
browser
and
access
the
url
you
observe
that
a
login
form
is
it
appears
that
we
have
discovered
a
hidden
subdomain
which
has
login
this
could
be
of
great
interest
to
a
security
summary
and
next
steps
congratulations
now
you
know
how
to
use
burp
intruder
to
enumerate
subdomains
for
a
this
methodology
can
open
up
more
attack
surface
for
you
to
test
which
can
increase
your
chances
of
successfully
compromising
a
test
for
information
on
how
you
could
use
burp
intruder
to
a
login
form
like
the
one
