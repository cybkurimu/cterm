you
can
manually
use
burp

your

to
interact
with
the

and
then
identify
that
the
interaction
has

typical
uses
for
burp

the
general
process
for
manual
use
of
burp

generate
collaborator
which
are
subdomains
of
the
collaborator
insert
the
payloads
into
a
request
and
send
the
request
to
the
target
poll
the
collaborator
to
see
whether
the
application
uses
the
injected
payload
to
interact
with
any
network
generating
payloads
you
can
directly
insert
collaborator
payloads
into
any
request
that
is
open
in
burp
on
the
request
and
select
insert
collaborator
payload
you
can
generate
multiple

at
once
in

enter
the

of

that
you

may
perform
a

it
may
then
initiate
another

a

the

are
received
by

they
may

we
periodically
add

that
your

you
can
view

you
can
add

you
can
track
